# Captcha-with-emoji-detection-using-CNN
In this project we are given a handwritten captcha which contains either english alphabets(capital) or emoji or both and we have to read it using CNN.
In this project I have created one notebook for data loading, preprocessing, segmentation and everything.
The used datasets are emoji.csv and A_Z Handwritten Data.csv
For running this project, we should run main.py file.
In this I have used two different models where one is trained on alphabets and one is trained on emojis and then both are used to detect complete captcha and the result from both is compared and answer was predicted
